# 2SI3-Labs

A repository I used to manage my coursework for the course: COMPENG 2SI3 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Currently Stored: 
 - Labs 1 & 2 (both are same parts of one cumulative lab)
 - Lab 3 (Stored under Lab_3_alt - Lab 3 DOES NOT WORK)


### Approach for Lab 1

To store more than 64 bits, an ASCII character was used to store each digit. This could have also been done using binary values. 
When an std::string is inputted, it is converted to a char array, and this array is manipulated for any relevant functions. 
The class stores number of digits, char array, and a bool to indicate whether the function is negative. 
This allows for future functions to be implemented easier. 

### Approach for LAb 2

The strategy stayed largely the same from the previous lab, where items were accessed
